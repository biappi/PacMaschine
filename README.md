PacMaschine
===========

If you ever feel the need of a pause when beatmaking, how about a nice
game of Pacman?!

This macOS application will connect to your Maschine MK I and provide you
some much needed relax!

Compile and launch the project, and select the game in the Maschine
hardware interface as if it was just a second instance of the instrument.

While this software will not modify anything permanent in your setup, it
of course comes "AS-IS".

The game itself is based on this great project for the
[Arduboy](http://arduboy.com) platform:

that I slightly modified to run on macOS with the resolution of the
Maschine screen.

The Maschine interface library comes from an earlier project of mine:
